#summary HOWTO: Building snowflake

= Introduction =

This is a short run-down on how to build snowflake.

Something to be aware of: build system is completely untested on anything but linux. If you're building on something else, you will get no where if you don't have a gcc/binutils toolchain capable of targeting i386-elf. You've been warned!

= Details =

Some pre-requisite software:
  * ocaml compiler tools
  * findlib
  * time
  * a C toolchain targeting i386-elf

Once all that is installed, it should be as simple as typing make from the root of the project source.

= Unsupported =

Building snowflake is currently not supported on mac os x or windows. It might work on BSD flavours. I'm not sure if it's possible to use a cross compiler, since parts need to be compiled for the host system, and other parts for i386-elf.

If you really get stuck, and are on an unsupported host operating system, I'd recommend setting up a virtual machine.

If you have tips and/or like to submit a patch to be able to configure the build system with specific host and target toolchains to use, that'd be awesome.
