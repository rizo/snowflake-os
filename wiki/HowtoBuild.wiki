#summary HOWTO: Building snowflake

= Introduction =

This is a short run-down on how to build snowflake.

Something to be aware of: build system is completely untested on anything but linux. If you're building on something else, you will get no where if you don't have a gcc/binutils toolchain capable of targeting i386-elf. You've been warned!

= Details =

Some pre-requisite software:
  * ocaml compiler tools, preferrably 3.10.x, 3.11.x untested
  * findlib
  * time
  * mkisofs
  * a C toolchain targeting i386-elf

Once all that is installed, it should be as simple as typing make from the root of the project source.

= Mac OS X =

Okies, I've been nice and made the build system able to cope with non-ELF hosts.

First off, you need to build an i386-elf cross compiler. Instructions can be found at http://m3os.wordpress.com/2009/03/29/tutorial-building-an-i386-elf-cross-compiler-and-binutils-on-os-x/.

Once you have your cross compiler, the steps look roughly like:
  # export TOOLSPREFIX=/path/to/your/cross-compiler/bin/i386-elf
  # make

For example, if you have the directory /usr/local/i386elf/bin which contains the following programs: i386-elf-gcc, i386-elf-as, and friends, then you would export TOOLSPREFIX=/usr/local/i386elf/bin/i386-elf. It will append "-gcc", "-as", and friends to TOOLSPREFIX and use these for building snowflake.

If all goes well, you should have a snowflake.native which is the kernel. If everything goes really well, you should also have a snowflake.iso to boot!

Small lil note from the OS X guy, here.  You need mkisofs to make that ISO, and for that you need to compile [ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/cdrecord/alpha/cdrtools-beta.tar.gz CDRecord and friends].  It's really easy, just get the tarball, and type "make && sudo make install".  Note that whomever wrote the CDRecord Makefile told it to install to /opt/schily, so you either need to do
 * {{{PATH=/path/to/i386-elf-toolchain/bin:/opt/schily:$PATH make}}}

Or optionally you can do what I did and do:
 * {{{sudo mv /opt/schily/bin/* /usr/bin/}}}

= Unsupported =

Building snowflake is currently not really supported on mac os x or windows. It might work on BSD flavours. I'm not sure if it's possible to use a cross compiler, since parts need to be compiled for the host system, and other parts for i386-elf.

If you really get stuck, and are on an unsupported host operating system, I'd recommend setting up a virtual machine.

If you have tips and/or like to submit a patch to be able to configure the build system with specific host and target toolchains to use, that'd be awesome.
